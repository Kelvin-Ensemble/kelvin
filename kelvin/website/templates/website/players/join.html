<h2> Auditions opening soon! </h2>
<hr class="primary"/>
<div class="left_align_text allow_bullets">
	<p>
		We’re really excited to see that you’re interested in applying for Kelvin!
		At Kelvin we wish for the orchestra to be as satisfying and challenging as possible while
		keeping things fair for all members - unfortunately we can’t fit 14 trumpets in!  To do this, the orchestra is auditioned new each
		year with <strong>everyone</strong> auditioning – even the committee!
	</p>
	<!-- <hr class="primary"/> -->
	<h2 style='margin-bottom: 16px;'> About the audition </h2>
	<p>
		We are still deciding on how the 2021 auditions will be held this year.  At the moment, due to the challenges of meeting everyone face-to-face, we think the auditions will be done by submitting a video of your playing (similarly to last year).
	</p>
	<p>
		We will update you here and on our social media links below with any changes.
	</p>
	<!--
	<p>
		What we’re looking for is a video where you introduce yourself (so we know who’s audition it is) and
		then show off your playing. We’d like to hear the excerpt for your instrument (and doubling
		instrument if applicable) and around 3 minutes of a piece of your choice that you feel shows your
		ability in its best light. Feel free to cut your piece short, we don’t need to hear the whole thing.
		Once you’ve submitted your video please fill out <a href="https://forms.gle/Qv2z25aoVajajh2i9">this form</a> to complete your audition.
	</p>

	<p >Your audition will only be watched by the audition panel and will be deleted once auditions are over.</p>
	<p style='margin-top: -22px;'><strong>The closing date for auditions has been extended to 11th October.</strong></p>
