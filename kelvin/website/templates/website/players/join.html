<h2> Auditions Currently Closed </h2>
<hr class="primary"/>
<div class="left_align_text allow_bullets">
	<p>
		We’re really excited to see that you’re interested in applying for Kelvin.
		At Kelvin we wish for the orchestra to be as satisfying and challenging as possible while
		keeping things fair for all members.  To achieve this, the orchestra is auditioned new each
		year, regardless if you are a new or previous member.
	</p>

	<p>
		Auditions for 2021-2022 are now finished.  Thank you very much if you auditioned; we were delighted by the interest in the orchestra this year.  The standards of all auditions were exceptional.  As a consequence, unfortunately we were unable to accept every player this year.  We are really sorry if you were unsuccessful, and would like to encourage you to retry in the future.
	</p>

	<p>
		More information about 2022-2023 auditions will be made available in September 2022.
	</p>

	<h2 style='margin-bottom: 16px;'> About the audition </h2>
	<p>
		Due to the challenges of meeting face-to-face on campus, auditions this year will be done by video submission (similarly to last year).
	</p>

	<p>
		We would like you to record a video where you introduce yourself and
		then show off your playing. We’d like to hear the excerpt for your instrument (and doubling
		instrument if applicable) and around 3 minutes of a piece of your choice that you feel shows your
		ability in its best light. Don't worry if you have to cut the piece short.
		Once you’ve submitted your video please fill out <a href="https://forms.gle/bi4CVb8CnSj7br4GA">this form</a> to complete your audition.
	</p>

	<p >Your audition will only be watched by the audition panel and will be deleted once auditions are over.</p>
	<p style='margin-top: -22px;'><strong>The closing date for auditions is the 27th September.</strong></p>
