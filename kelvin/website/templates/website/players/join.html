        <p>
            We’re really excited to see that you’re interested in applying for Kelvin.
            At Kelvin we wish for the orchestra to be as satisfying and challenging as possible while
            keeping things fair for all members.  To achieve this, the orchestra is auditioned new each
            year, regardless if you are a new or previous member.
        </p>
        <p>
            Auditions for 2023-2024 are now finished.  Thank you very much if you auditioned; we were delighted by the interest in the orchestra this year.  The standards of all auditions were exceptional.  As a consequence, unfortunately we were unable to accept every player this year.  We are really sorry if you were unsuccessful, and would like to encourage you to retry in the future.
        </p>
        <p>More information about 2024-2025 auditions will be made available in September 2024.</p> -->

	<p>
		We are pleased to announce that we will hold face to face auditions this year!
	</p>

    <p>
		In the auditions, we’d like to hear the prepared orchestral excerpts for your instrument (and doubling
		instrument if applicable) and a short piece of your choice that you feel shows your
		ability in its best light. Don't worry if you have to cut the piece short.
	</p> 

	<p>Your auditions will be assessed by the audition panel.</p>
